#+title: Hi, I'm James 👋

I build and maintain small, deliberate systems.

Most of my work focuses on Linux-based workflows, documentation-driven projects,
and tools that behave predictably and are easy to reason about.

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
USABILITY         = Ease of use, without deep technical knowledge
READABILITY       = Human-readable and documentation
PREDICTABILITY    = Less surprises and reproducible
MAINTAINABILITY   = Comprehensive planning and strong foundation
COHESIVE + VISUAL = Working well technically AND visually
