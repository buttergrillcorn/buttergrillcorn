#+title: Hi, I'm James 👋

I build and maintain small, deliberate systems.

Most of my work focuses on Linux-based workflows, documentation-driven projects,
and tools that behave predictably and are easy to reason about.

* Values

+ Usability :: Ease of use, even for those without deep technical knowledge
+ Readability :: Human-readable code
+ Predictability :: Less surprises = less errors
+ Maintainability :: Comprehensive planning and strong foundation
+ Cohesive and visuals :: Working well technically, and visually

* Projects

** [[https://growing.wiki][Growing Wiki]]

Wiki-style site exploring atomic documentation, inspired by Zettelkasten.
