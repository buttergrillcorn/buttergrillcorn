I build and maintain small, deliberate systems.

Most of my work focuses on Linux-based workflows,
documentation-driven projects, and tools that behave
predictably and are easy to reason about.

Principles:
- Explicit configuration over hidden magic
- Readability over cleverness
- Systems that can be understood end to end

Current focus:
- growing.wiki  — a living documentation system
- dotfiles      — a reproducible Linux workflow

This repository documents how these systems evolve over time.

|-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Usability*         | Ease of use, even for those without deep technical knowledge |
| *Readability*       | Human-readable code                                          |
| *Predictability*    | Less surprises = less errors                                 |
| *Maintainability*   | Comprehensive planning and strong foundation                 |
| *Cohesive + Visual* | Working well technically, and visually                       |
